								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
								As I said, my name is Norbert. I was born in '92 and I'm living in Budapest.
							    I'm studying <a href="http://fmt.bme.hu/node/1251?language=en">Photogrammetry and Geoinformatics at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics</a>.
							    In my free time I like to read about new technologies then try 'n' learn them.
							    I'm interested in coding, machine learning (especially deep learning) and in computer vision.
								Along with these I also like, *NIX systems, IT security and geoinformatics, Augmented Reality.
								And I would like getting familiar with ERPs (e.g. SAP) in the future.

								<h2>Interests</h2>
							</header>

							<h3>Machine learning & computer vision</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								These are my latest interests. I find these fields really interesting and powerful and imho these will be really importants in the future.
								<br>
								In computer vision I'm reading articles and studies and practicing with the OpenCV library.
								<br>
								I'm kinda newbie in machine learning, but I would like to be an expert. Most of the time I'm using Keras with Tensorflow backend.
							</p>

							<h3>Coding</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								When I'm coding I use Python, JavaScript, BASH, and C++ (of course also use HTML and CSS). At the past I also use Java, C# and Pascal.
								<br>
								From these my all time favourite is Python. I just love it. The package management, the virtual environments and the whole language is awesome.
								In package management only the NodeJS can beat it imho, but this is another story.
							</p>
							<h3>Operating Systems</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								I grow up on Windows(95 - ) with a few years of C64, but in the last 6 years I'm using linux next to the Windows.
								Mainly Ubuntu, but also tried Debian, Fedora, Manjaro, Arch, OpenSUSE, deepin, Solus and Mint.
								I really like to test new distros and desktop enviornments.
								I found Ubuntu the most stable (I really liked Unity, don't blame me) and the hardware support may better than the others.
							</p>
							<h3>The rest</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								I find photogrammetry and geoinformatics to an interesting field.
								Always liked to create point cloud and mesh models from photos or working with a lot of data in a GIS (mostly QGIS).
								<br>
								The IT security is just a hobby.
								I like to reading articles about this topic and keep myself "up-to-date".
								Using tools and understand how things work is the most important.
								I like to play with IDA and solve wargames, CTF challanges.

								<h2>Projects</h2>
							</header>

							<h3>Pillproof</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								This is just a fantasy name for a pill recognition system which I'm working on at the moment.
								You can check it out <a href="https://pillproof.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
								<li>It's currently a free plan on Heroku, so you may have to wait for the system getting ready.</li>
								<li>It's in early development stage.</li>
								<li>I cannot share the source code because of my contract.</li>
							</p>

							<h3>Pathfinder</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								<a href="https://github.com/pyrooka/pathfinder">Pathfinder</a> is a QGIS plugin for pathfinding in raster layers.
								<a href="projects/pathfinder">Here</a> is a demo from a result.
								The starting and ending points is from the film called 'The Martian' and of course the DTM is a part from the Mars' surface.
							</p>

							<h3>GitHub Social Graph</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								As its name says, create a graph from the connected (follower, followin) users starting from one specific user.
								The source code is <a href="https://github.com/pyrooka/github-social-graph">here</a> while you can find an interactive demo <a href="projects/gsg">here</a>.
							</p>

							<h3>Augmented Reality with AR.js</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								I just made some simple <a href="projects/ar">AR demo</a> for my friend's presentation at the university.
								The whole thing running in the browser, so you don't have to download anything.
								Incredible how this field evolving.
							</p>

							<hr>

							<h3>Coding</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								You can find rest of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/pyrooka" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
								Those are small projects too, but I didn't want to create new sections for them.
							</p>

							<h3>Linux</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								I'm running a little server @home.
								It's Ubuntu on a Banana PI.
								Just a few service what I use: samba, OpenVPN, FTP and some personal scripts.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the past I had a project where I had to make <a href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/">OpenSees</a> (Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation) run on the <a href="https://superman.eik.bme.hu/">supercomputer of my university</a>.
								It was a really interesting project and I've learnt a lot from it.
								I had to wrote a step by step docs for the teachers (with limited shell knowledge), <a href="data/openseed.pdf">here</a> you can find it.
								Sorry it's in hungarian, but I was too lazy to translate it.
							</p>

							<h3>Photogrammetry</h3>
							<br>
							<p>
								I can show only a few model from this field.
								You can check them on <a href="https://sketchfab.com/brandonx">Sketchfab</a>.
